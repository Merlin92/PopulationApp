### Task: People of Ireland ###

In the Assignment 5 folder on Blackboard, you will find a file named “IrishPopulation.txt”. The file contains the midyear population of Ireland, during the years 1950 through 1990.

The first line in the file contains the population for 1950, the second line contains the population for 1951, and so forth.

Create an application that reads the file’s contents into an array or a List.

The application should display the following data in an easy to understand manner

  The increase in population each year e.g. (1951 there is a population increase of 31,710)
  The average annual change in population during the time period
  The year with the greatest increase in population during the time period
  The year with the least increase in population during the time period

1) Handle unexpected errors. (Invalid inputs, file not found etc.)

2) Follow good programming conventions for object names: include comments for some
methods and at the top of the file to explain what the application is about.

3) Give the form a name that will display at the top of the form.

4) Include your name in the bottom right corner “Programmed by ................”
